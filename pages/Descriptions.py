ChatGTP (General Text Processing)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) based conversational chatbot that answers general knowledge questions using semantic similarity instead of keyword matching.

The chatbot processes raw text data, understands the meaning of user queries, and retrieves the most relevant factual answer from a structured dataset.

This project is designed as a first NLP project to understand the complete NLP pipeline, from raw text to an intelligent conversational system.

Objectives

Build an NLP chatbot from raw text data

Understand semantic similarity using sentence embeddings

Retrieve accurate answers from a fact-based dataset

Design a clean and modular NLP pipeline""")
